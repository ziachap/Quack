# Quack
Quack is a language I made when I was bored and decided it would be fun to make a new language. I will slowly add new features to this.

At the moment Quack supports:
- Variable declaration and assignment
- Numerical data
- Add and subtract arithmetic operations
- Print

An example of Quack code:
```
declare a ;
declare b ;
b = 3 ;
a = 2 + b - 1 ;
print a ;
```

Quack code is transpiled into JavaScript code. I plan on adding more transpilation targets in the future and perhaps even compilation!
